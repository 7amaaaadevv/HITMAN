HaileyBot aims to be an incredibly versatile bot; our goal is to have every feature you could ever think of, as well as some you would never even imagine. Suggest whatever feature you want, and if it's a good idea, it'll be added to the bot.

We have features for helping server owners spread the word about their servers, and also for helping new Discord users find a community they want to join. HaileyBot can link channels across different servers, so that you can meet new people and form new connections. We also have an extensive list of moderation commands for helping you keep your server the way you want it to be. There are also many other commands that vastly improve the general user experience.
