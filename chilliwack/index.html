	<p>The full story of what really happened to me in November 2017</p>
	<hr>
	<p>It started at school on Friday November 17. The vice principal caught me sneaking back on campus after smoking, and I was sent to the office. My parents were phoned, and I made an impulsive decision that I wish I didn't. I composed a new email and wrote about the fact that I'm trans, then I sent it to my parents. When I got home I was met with yelling. When I'm yelled at, I shut down, so that's what happened. Mom kept shouting questions at me and I couldn't answer cuz I was sobbing and stammering too much. Eventually she got fed up with me not answering and she yelled something like "if you can't answer my questions then you can't live here", so I went to my room, put on a hoodie, threw an extra one in my bag, grabbed my keys and helmet, and rode away. At that point I had no plans; all I knew was that I never wanted to go home again. I decided to ride down the trails because that always made me feel better. I passed Daniel and stopped to talk to him. He asked what I was doing and I told him that mom and I had a fight and she needed time to cool off. He asked when I was going home and I said 'probably monday'. He asked if I needed money and I told him I didn't wanna be a leech, but in reality, yes, I really wanted money. We rode to his place and he gave me 20 dollars. I thanked him, and as I rode away he called out, "Don't spend it on drugs!" "I won't!" I yelled back, then turned the corner and disappeared. I went to a Tim Hortons and got a croissant and a coffee, then posted something about it to social media using my iPad.</p>

	<p>I rode around a lot after that, and tbh I don't remember exactly where I went. I know that at that point I didn't leave the area or go anywhere I hadn't before. I ended up on some more trails, and followed a beaten path to the end. I locked my bike to a tree, then laid down and tried to sleep. It was dark out, but I had no idea what time it was. After about a half hour of <i>not</i> sleeping, I got up, grabbed my bike's headlight, and went for a walk. I walked for probably about 2 hours total before coming back to my bike.</p>
